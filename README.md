# [AssistPro](https://assistpro-test.vercel.app) üåê
Comprehensive web tool designed to simplify the process of identifying class articulations across various colleges and universities. It is particularly useful for students planning to transfer and needing to find equivalent courses at their new institution.

P.S. I have it hosted on a vercel server right now for our demo front end, click the **AssistPro** header in blue.
# TODO:
- [ ] Update/Format Website with features, look into this [layout](https://github.com/hirdey795/assistpro/blob/main/Extra_README/README_LAYOUT.md)
- [x] Scrape all UNI/CSU Classes
- [ ] Return all classes from colleges which are available for the selected class that the user picked. (Frontend/Backend Communication)
- [x] Make scraping headless optional (not need window popup everytime we scrape)
- [ ] FastAPI / Flask ?

# Use Case Scenario:

The JSON Object below showcases the differences of articulations, between Diablo Valley College (DVC) & Sacramento City College (SCC).

Let's say our client wants to transfer to UC Berkeley, they need to finish **COMPSCI 61C**.

We can see that SCC has **No Course Articulated** for **COMPSCI 61C**, whereas DVC has a course ,**COMSC 260**, articulated with UC Berkeley.

```js
{
    "('To: University of California, Berkeley', 'From: Diablo Valley College')": [
        "Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences, Lower Division B.S.",
        {
            "MATH 1A": "MATH 192",
            ...
            "COMPSCI 61C": "COMSC 260"
        }
    ],
    "('To: University of California, Berkeley', 'From: Sacramento City College')": [
        "Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences, Lower Division B.S.",
        {
            "MATH 1A": "MATH 400",
            ...
            "COMPSCI 61C": "No Course Articulated"
        }
    ]
}
```
